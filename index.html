   The study of aerodynamics, rooted in the natural world, has significantly influenced modern engineering. By observing and understanding 
   how birds, insects and other natural entities interact with air, engineers have developed advanced technologies that mimic these natural 
   aerodynamic principles. For instance, the design of aircraft wings and fuselages often draws inspiration from the wings of birds and the 
   streamlined bodies of fish. These designs aim to reduce drag and increase lift, enhancing fuel efficiency and performance. By integrating 
   these natural aerodynamic principles, engineers continue to push the boundaries of innovation, creating designs that are not only efficient
   and effective but also sustainable and harmonious with the environment.

  Active  Learning (Angluin,  1988,  Cohn  et  al.,  1994)  is  a  paradigm  where  a  concept  is  learnt  by  an intelligent machine through 
   the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the 
   querying strategy, used to sample candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential to  improve  
   the  classification  model.  Various  strategies  have  been  proposed  including;  Query  by Committee  (Seung  et  al.,  1992),Monte  Carlo 
   estimation  (Roy  and  McCallum,  2001),  uncertainty sampling  (Lewis  and  Gale,  1994)  and  version  space  reduction  (margin  sampling)
   (Tong  and  Koller, 2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are presented  for  labeling, 
   to  a  machine  (database)  or  human  oracle  that  has  knowledge  of  the  class labels.  After  adding  the  newly  labeled  instances  to  the
   current  training  set,  a  revised  model  is subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve anefficient, incremental advancement of learning 
   at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is
   contrary to the model, causing the classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008)

Falcon B-2 Spirit stealth bomber 
The design of the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber has been significantly influenced by the peregrine falcon, particularly in terms of aerodynamics and stealth capabilities.
The peregrine falcon is known for its sleek, aerodynamic shape, which allows it to dive at speeds close to 200 mph. Its streamlined body reduces air resistance, enabling
it to move swiftly and efficiently through the air. Inspired by this, the B-2 bomber features a smooth, curved design that minimises drag and enhances aerodynamic efficiency.
This shape helps the aircraft achieve better fuel efficiency and longer range. Chirp (July 21 2022).
    
The B-2 bomber borrows several aerodynamic principles from the Falcon:
    
(Body)Stealth Shape: Falcons have sleek, streamlined bodies that minimise drag and reduce turbulence. Similarly, the B-2's shape is designed to reduce radar cross-section and
 minimise drag, enhancing its stealth capabilities.


Wing Configuration:The falcon’s wing structure allows for exceptional manoeuvrability, enabling it to make sharp turns and rapid dives. The B-2’s flying wing design, inspired
by the falcon, provides excellent stability and control, allowing it to perform complex manoeuvres while maintaining stealth. The principles of sleek, streamlined wings that 
minimise drag and improve speed help the bomber maintain high speeds and fuel efficiency. 
    
Surface Texture: Falcons have smooth feathers that help them glide silently through the air. The B-2 uses advanced materials and surface treatments to achieve a similar effect,
reducing noise and radar detection.
The B-2's distinctive "Hawk's beak" profile is also reminiscent of the falcon's head, further emphasising the influence of the bird on the bomber's design.
Essentially, by studying falcons, engineers could craft an aircraft that is both stealthy and highly efficient in flight. Nature's own aerodynamics at work. 

Winglets 
Eagle wings have long fascinated engineers and scientists, leading to significant advancements in the design of modern winglets. These natural marvels have provided insights into
reducing drag, enhancing lift, and improving overall aerodynamic efficiency. Eagles are masters of the sky, known for their ability to soar effortlessly for long periods. 
One of the key features of their wings is the upturned feathers at the tips, which play a crucial role in minimising drag.

These feathers reduce the strength of wingtip vortices—spirals of air created by the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the wing. By studying these natural
wingtip modifications, engineers have developed winglets that mimic this effect, reducing induced drag and improving fuel efficiency.

By adding winglets tilted upward at the tips, either to new aircraft or as retrofits to existing models, airlines achieved significant fuel savings HYDRO (June 2019) concluded 
that—3-5% reductions in fuel burn—depending on flight length and aircraft type. 
Additionally, winglets play a vital role in modern aerodynamics, this reduction in drag results in improved airflow over the wings, enhancing fuel efficiency and flight stability.
Consequently, winglets contribute to significant fuel savings and lower greenhouse gas emissions, winglets exemplify the elegance and efficiency of contemporary aviation engineering.

Applications 
Boeing’s 747-400, introduced in 1989, featured winglets that increased its range by 3.5% compared to the 747-300, which lacked winglets. 
Airbus A319: These aircraft see the most consistent fuel and emissions savings, averaging around 4.8% improvement in fuel consumption.





Wing morphing 
Wing morphing is an innovative concept that involves altering the shape, structure, and aerodynamic profile of an aircraft's wings during flight. This technology improves the
performance, efficiency, and versatility of aircraft by allowing them to adapt to varying flight conditions. Birds, such as eagles and falcons have inspired this concept. 
They constantly adjust their wing shape and feather positions to control their flight dynamics, which allows them to be agile and efficient in the air. 
Engineers have been working on adaptive wing technologies, mimicking these natural adjustments to improve aircraft performance. These morphing wings can change shape during flight,
adapting its aerodynamic shape to each flight condition to obtain better performances, such as flight envelope, flight control, flight range. ScienceDirect  (June 2018).
Birds use their feathers to tweak airflow and stability. This concept has led to the development of aircraft with adaptive control surfaces that mimic feather movements to
enhance stability and control. Birds effortlessly switch between flapping and gliding to conserve energy. Morphing wings in aircraft mimic this by adjusting their shape for different
phases of flight, leading to fuel savings and improved efficiency.



Manta Ray-Inspired Plane Could be the Next “SpaceX of Aviation”
JetZero Inc., a pioneering aviation startup, is boldly transforming the blueprint of commercial passenger aircraft. The company has introduced a revolutionary low carbon, 
triangle-shaped design, resembling a giant manta ray gliding through the skies.
JetZero's innovative aircraft deviates from the traditional design, which typically feature long, narrow tubes with separate wings and tail stabilizers.
Instead, it features a shorter and wider fuselage, this structure not only gives the aircraft a distinctive appearance but also significantly enhances its lift capabilities.
The unique benefits of JetZero’s Blended Wing design become evident through its remarkable features.
Unlike traditional aircraft where the wings and fuselage are distinct component,
 The aircraft merges its wings and fuselage seamlessly, eliminating any clear dividing line. 
Its triangular cabin includes three aisles, enhancing the boarding experience and maximizing interior space. The spacious interior maximizes the use of available space,
providing more room for passengers and their belongings.This design innovation reduces drag, allowing for a quieter and more stable flight experience.  LJ. (November 14, 2023)
Additionally, the Blended Wing design brings numerous operational advantages. The aircraft's lighter structure reduces fuel consumption, contributing to its low-carbon footprint. 
The quieter operation minimizes noise pollution, making it more environmentally friendly and preferable for airports located near residential areas.
